# Introduction

This is the official public API for [Translation.io](https://tanslation.io). It was designed with
these two goals in mind:

 1. Create simple endpoints to be able to synchronize translations between any framework and Translation.io.

 2. Allow teams to interact with main models of Translation.io the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) way.
